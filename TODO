Zared:
	Begin coding the GUI. Don't worry about connecting anything to the
	database yet, just get everything in the correct place. Customers will
	login using their email.

	For each pizza, they'll be able to choose:
	  1) The size of the pizza (small, medium, large)
	  2) The type of crust
	  3) The sauce to use as the base
	  4) One or more cheeses
	  5) Zero or more toppings

	The total cost of the pizza will be determined based on cost of each
	individual ingrediant. The Pizza class has a 'getCost' method which
	computes this.

Blake:
	Begin coding other classes that we'll need. You can use the Dia diagram
	to figure out the classes. It might help for you to build a table schema
	first to figure out what properties to include in each class.

Jake & Thomas:
	Begin building some charts. You have full creative liberty on this one.
	An inheritance chart would be nice to turn in with the final project.
